Ad Stagirium 1.5.28
καὶ γὰρ τὸ κρυβῆναι​ καὶ τὸ τὴν ἁμαρτίαν ὁμολογῆ​σαι καὶ τὸ σπουδάζειν τὸν μὲν​ ἄνδρα
 ἐπὶ τὴν γυναῖκα ἐκεί​νην δὲ ἐπὶ τὸν ὄφιν τὴν αἰ​τίαν τῶν γεγενημένων με​ταγαγεῖν
 δεδοικότων ἐστὶ​ καὶ τρεμόντων καὶ τὸ κῦρος ἐπεγνωκότων τοῦ Θεοῦ

Ad Stagirium 1.5.28 translation
Because the fact that they hid and confessed their mistake and that the man was eager to
put the blame on the woman for what happened and she the snake are characteristics of
of those who are afraid and trembling and know the power of God.
