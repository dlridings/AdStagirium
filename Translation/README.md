# Notes

I have noticed that while I transcribe, a good translation can crop up
in my head. This is something I can work with to break up the working
day.

Just a skeleton format for now. Book 1 chapters 1-4 are listed by verse
so that I can jump in anywhere and translate a verse or verses as I get
the urge.
