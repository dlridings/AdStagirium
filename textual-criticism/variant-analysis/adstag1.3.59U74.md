- **Geographical Spread**: []

## 🔄 Directionality & Genealogy
- **Likely Original Reading**: [e.g., Reading A]
- **Genealogical Relationships**:
  - [e.g., B likely derived from A via harmonization]
  - [e.g., C appears to be a conflation of A and B]

## 🌿 Local Stemma Placement
- **Proposed Stemma**:
  - [Diagram or description, e.g., A → B → C]
- **Contamination Notes**: [e.g., Manuscript F shows mixture of A and B]

## 📝 Notes & Decisions
- Depends on whether one takes τὸ γεγονός as subject (intransitive) or object (transitive). I am debating between B and C. Intransive is difficult because of the nom. sg. in the participles that go before. That would leave τὸ γεγονός hanging. I am going with C because of A25, La22, La2, older and more consistent than B. Though the aorist feels like a better choice from the context.
