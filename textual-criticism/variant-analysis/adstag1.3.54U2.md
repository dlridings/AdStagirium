- **Stylistic/Contextual Fit**: [e.g., Reading B aligns with second sophistic style]

## 🧭 External Evidence

- **Geographical Spread**: []

## 🔄 Directionality & Genealogy
- **Likely Original Reading**: [e.g., Reading A]
- **Genealogical Relationships**:
  - [e.g., B likely derived from A via harmonization]
  - [e.g., C appears to be a conflation of A and B]

## 🌿 Local Stemma Placement
- **Proposed Stemma**:
  - [Diagram or description, e.g., A → B → C]
- **Contamination Notes**: [e.g., Manuscript F shows mixture of A and B]

## 📝 Notes & Decisions
- Provisionally, based on more older mss and higher coherence among the witnesses, I am proposing B as the initial text.
