## 🧬 Manuscript Support
| Reading | Manuscripts | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| A      | Bas | lone but 54-58 with B and 60 with C, D |
| B      | A116 A25 A336 B39 Bodl Est La22 La35 LaSM M111 M118 Marc Mon Nan P01 P74 Pal Patm S249 S32 Sin Taur V1639 V1920 V2036 V536 V560 V565 V566 V569 V571 | Most of the oldest, Savile |

Bas is alone, but 54-58 is in common with B, while 60 agrees with more than B and E.
