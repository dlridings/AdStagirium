1.2.18
1.3.12 in V2250 5v ἀνσία ??? 
1.5.9 Local stemma: when the Taur-group simply has another text, it is uncomfortable to say that it stems from the chosen text. It could simply be that there are two versions, two versions going back to the day. If works were delivered orally, there could have been two deliveries. I am leaving it without a local stemma for the time being. This means that the whole text should be reviewed with the same principle in order for the text flow to be consistent.
1.5.12.4 is then problematic. It does seem that the A-text was the original, and perhaps it was above in 1.5.9 as well.
1.5.12.48 Not 100% sure about the A-text. B is possible.
1.5.13.10 Should probably be regularized. It is interesting orthographically, but not textually.
1.5.17.28 Not 100% sure about ἀπέδεικξε/ἐπέδειξε. The first is the more "difficult", so I am going with it.
1.5.17.78-80 Another case where I don't want to add the Taur-group to a local stemmas
1.5.23 Come back to with a focus on the text of Bas
1.5.25.34 αὐτοῦ/αὐτῳ it is a toss up. The dative (presently a variant) might be the preferred text.
1.5.23 This is an example where it feels unnatural to build a local stemma putting the Taur-group as a branch off from the initial text. There is a nagging feeling that we might have two parallel traditions, each deserving an initial text. Just a nagging feeling, not a dogmatic position.
1.5.25 The choice between the genitive αὐτοῦ and the dative αὐτῳ needs to be studied more closely.
1.5.27 Recollate. It works, but one large omission by La35 is presented as several small ones.
1.5.29 Is another passage where it is uncomfortable adding the Taur-group as a branch off of the initial text. There could very well be 2 "initial texts" way back.
1.5.33 I didn't dare to regularize past place 150. I think it is εἶδεν that is causing trouble. It simply won't collate if I go further and everything before is lost. I split these up inte 33a and 33b and then it went ok. Evidently it hit some kind of limit. The editor is not meant to be used with long texts, not even long verses.
1.5.39 40-46 review the word order
1.5.51 This number, 51, got skipped in all transcriptions. It went from 50 to 52. No text is missing, the numbering is just off.
1.5.55 Return to: τῶν πιστευόντων εἰς αὐτὸν or τῶν πιστευόντων αὐτῳ There is early evidence for the latter
1.5.60 is corrupt in the Taur-group
