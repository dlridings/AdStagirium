# Notes from the second collation

## Quirks

Quirks in the xml-2-json that need looking it. It seems that if you use Corrector2 when you have seen at least two hands in a manuscript, that it will even count on a Corrector1 in a passage, and if it isn't present, it ends up as an omission.
1.2.8 La2-c "omission", since La2-c1 was used.

## Individual passages

1.1.15.44- (καὶ and ὁρμῆσαι ἐλθειν και ἐπὶ ...)
1.1.16.4 δέ and δὲ couldn't be regularized in the first step
1.1.14.2 won't fully regularize (καὶ) in M118, V1639 ...
1.1.26, 1.1.28, 1.1.30, 1.2.1, 1.2.13 Just examples of how CollateX does not handle word order
1.2.6.18-28 Review ... groups show up here
1.2.7 Is pretty wild (S249)
1.2.9 P18 is damaged and turns out erratic in the collation. Fix manually. ***
1.2.18.24-30 return to. Not at all sure about my reading for the initial text
1.2.21 ἀνῃρῆσθαι or ἀνῃρτῆσθαι : deserves a review (note: should be ἀνηρτῆσθαι not ἀνῃρ-) aBase changed, but not recollated. Still not sure about it either.
1.2.22 τῆς γῆς or simply γῆς 
1.2.23.46 αὐτόν or αὐτοῖς ? // changed from τῶν λοιπῶν ζωῶν to τὰ λοιπὰ ζῶα
1.2.24.20-24 A good example of how the Taur group clarifies
1.2.26.88-92 another example of the Taur group clarifying
1.2.28.8 μόνοις or μόνον not simple. aBase might be wrong.
1.2.32 Difficult εἶδος Bas LaSM and B39 display a reading unknown to others ***
1.2.35.20-36 An example of regularized variant readings ar1 ar2
1.2.40.44-50 Definitely return to this for study
1.2.40.84 ἐγίνετο or ἐγένετο ? return to
1.2.40.18, 1.2.40.50 Full of iotacisms that are ambiguous and potentially significant *** The verse is a mess. 18: κατοικίσαι / κατοικῆσαι
1.3.12 in V2250 5v ἀνσία ??? 
1.3.22.2-8 Set out explicit reasons for deciding the local stemma. What are the arguments against the shortest, Bas, being the correct reading. ***
1.3.28.36 ἐνὸν or ἐνῆν ?
1.3.38.24 the optative or subjunctive. ὅταν points to the subjunctive
1.3.39 V2036 and P18 both have missing sections, but for different reasons. V2036 was bound wrong
1.3.54.62-64 V2250 ... think about it.
1.3.62.32 Another small example where Bas, an early manuscript, aligns with the Taur group. So many readings from the Taur group go back to an earlier text form.
1.3.63.14-16 is another where Bas falls in with the Taur group.
1.3.64.14 V1639's iotacism gives a false reading: εἰμι instead of εἰ μὴ
1.3.66.4 omit μὲν ???
1.4.12 Criticus is encoding the correction at last word erroneously. ***
1.4.13.14 ἀδικῆται or ἠδίκηται ? The ἄν implies the subjunctive, but there are variants without
1.4.16 ἐπιδείξασθαι or ἐπιδείξαι
1.4.17 does not collate (message from the editor) It did in March. position 32, Savile had bracketed it out and they disturbed. This means that he did not have access to: A25, Est, M136, Patm, Taur, V560. Those manuscripts do not have ὁ and he would not have needed the brackets.
1.4.17.18 verb form of ἐπηρεάσται ... review.
1.4.21.36 Still getting false omissions in connection with corrections.
1.4.25.52 πάντα or πάντων τῶν ἀλόγων τὰ γένα ?
1.4.29 revisit
1.4.59 revisit
1.4.60.22-26 revisit
1.5.9 Local stemma: when the Taur-group simply has another text, it is uncomfortable to say that it stems from the chosen text. It could simply be that there are two versions, two versions going back to the day. If works were delivered orally, there could have been two deliveries. I am leaving it without a local stemma for the time being. This means that the whole text should be reviewed with the same principle in order for the text flow to be consistent.
1.5.12.4 is then problematic. It does seem that the A-text was the original, and perhaps it was above in 1.5.9 as well.
1.5.12.48 Not 100% sure about the A-text. B is possible.
1.5.13.10 Should probably be regularized. It is interesting orthographically, but not textually.
1.5.17.28 Not 100% sure about ἀπέδεικξε/ἐπέδειξε. The first is the more "difficult", so I am going with it.
1.5.17.78-80 Another case where I don't want to add the Taur-group to a local stemmas
1.5.23 Come back to with a focus on the text of Bas
1.5.25.34 αὐτοῦ/αὐτῳ it is a toss up. The dative (presently a variant) might be the preferred text.
1.5.23 This is an example where it feels unnatural to build a local stemma putting the Taur-group as a branch off from the initial text. There is a nagging feeling that we might have two parallel traditions, each deserving an initial text. Just a nagging feeling, not a dogmatic position.
1.5.25 The choice between the genitive αὐτοῦ and the dative αὐτῳ needs to be studied more closely.
1.5.27 Recollate. It works, but one large omission by La35 is presented as several small ones.
1.5.29 Is another passage where it is uncomfortable adding the Taur-group as a branch off of the initial text. There could very well be 2 "initial texts" way back.
1.5.33 I didn't dare to regularize past place 150. I think it is εἶδεν that is causing trouble. It simply won't collate if I go further and everything before is lost. I split these up inte 33a and 33b and then it went ok. Evidently it hit some kind of limit. The editor is not meant to be used with long texts, not even long verses.
1.5.36-1.5.37 Do not appear to have been collated. Instead 1.3.36-37 was collated *** It was, but I can't find it locally. Make sure 33a and 33b are ok too.
1.5.39 40-46 review the word order *** Chose possibly "b" as the initial text.
1.5.47 18 is another example of a Taur-group not really explained by the initial text unless it just happened in parallel. I am going to draw it that way in the local stemma. Perhaps some realationship with some others in the "a" text will turn up.
1.5.51 This number, 51, got skipped in all transcriptions. It went from 50 to 52. No text is missing, the numbering is just off.
1.5.52 26 and 32 should be regularized and recollated.
1.5.54.30-34 review the local stemma
1.5.55 Return to: τῶν πιστευόντων εἰς αὐτὸν or τῶν πιστευόντων αὐτῳ There is early evidence for the latter
1.5.56.38 ὅτι or ὃς starting to consider the latter. It affects the subject of θήλει
1.5.60 is corrupt in the Taur-group
