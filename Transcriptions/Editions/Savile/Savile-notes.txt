Savile tends to favor the Taur group:
1.4.13 (ἀλλ’, omitted by the main group
1.4.17 Follows Taur-group and an unknown reading in the marging -αζεσθαιclosest being Pal
1.4.17 Brackets a Taur-group reading. Does not seem to know the other group
1.4.27 (21) οὗτος (against Pal and Mon)
1.4.36 Follows NT ?, with Taur in the margin
1.4.47 ἑαυτοῖς/ἑαυτοὺς Here Taur has the majority reading. In the margin Savile reports the accusative as found in V560 and S32
1.4.49 Migne V571 La22 followed a different text (παρεχηκότα)
1.4.52 Savile follows Taur (προειπὼν) but reports προεῖπε of the majority group (with V560)
1.4.52 Follows Taur word order: εἴκοσι καὶ ἑκατόν ἐτῶν
1.4.53 τεκταίνεσθαι/ὑφαίνεσθαι Savile follows Taur-group
1.4.54 Savile follows majority (with V560 La22) τῶν ἀπειληθέντων τὴν μνήμην with Taur-group in the margin
1.4.56 σοφός/σοφώτατος Taur-group in a nutshell, which Savile follows
1.4.50 Savile follows Pal against all the others τὴν τοῦ διαβόλου φυγεῖν ὁδὸν *** breaks the pattern
1.4.61 Word order at the end can be interesting Migne does not follow Savile here
1.4.65 Savile follows Pal Neap and V1629 in word order
1.5 starts 92 line 25
