This is a collection of transcriptions (Greek) to John Chrysostom's Ad Stagirium

2024-11-29
Two manuscripts for Ad Stagirium book one have been set up, Vat1639 and LaSM.

The first page of each have been transcribed using OTE, the Online Transcription editor
at Birmingham https://itsee-wce.birmingham.ac.uk/ote/transcriptiontool

The work was exported and id's in the xml were adjusted so that the exported files
match the names of files in git. They can just be copied over the old file.
