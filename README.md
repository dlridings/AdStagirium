Habent sua fata libelli

The Cajus Fabricius mentioned throughout these notes is the one who wrote
his thesis titled:

Zu den Jugendscriften des Johannes Chrysostomos
Untersuchungen zum Klassizismus
des vierten Jahrhunderts

CWK Gleerup - Lund 1962

and NOT the Cajus Fabricius who published Positive Christianity in the Third
Reich. Any past confusion must have pained and distressed him.

Fabricius had an agreement with Teubner in Berlin for an edition of John
Chrysostom's Ad Stagirum a daemone vexatum. At the time there was a thesis
that there was a Corpus Monasticum and this would be one of several works.
That idea has been discarded.

In the unsorted papers Cajus Fabricius left, I found an order for a manuscript
made by the university library of Lund University dated 1966. I have added
scans of some of what he left behind in the appropriate directory. I will add
more as my work progresses and I can make sense of the loose notes.

This is a collection of transcriptions (Greek) to John Chrysostom's Ad Stagirium.
The work was taken over by Ridings in the mid-1990's but got sidetracked by an
EU project (PAROLE LE2017) that was crashing in Gothenburg and he was asked to
take over. Ridings had funding and used it to support a graduate student, Ingela
Nilsson, presently professor in Uppsala. When she moved on to Uppsala, the Department
of Classics (Greek) evidently cleaned her room out and trashed all transcriptions and
copies of manuscripts she left behind. That put a big dent in the work.

Ridings had been moving the transcriptions over to a form that Collate, by Peter
Robinson, could use and presented the status at Oxford.

I, Ridings, brought it back to life.
