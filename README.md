Habent sua fata libelli

The Cajus Fabricius mentioned throughout these notes is the one who wrote
his thesis titled:

Zu den Jugendscriften des Johannes Chrysostomos
Untersuchungen zum Klassizismus
des vierten Jahrhunderts

CWK Gleerup - Lund 1962

and NOT the Cajus Fabricius who published Positive Christianity in the Third
Reich. Any confusion in the past must have pained and distressed him.

Fabricius had an agreement with Teubner in Berlin for an edition of John
Chrysostom's Ad Stagirum a daemone vexatum. At the time there was a thesis
that there was a Corpus Monasticum and this would be one of several works.
That idea has been discarded.

In the unsorted papers Cajus Fabricius left, I found an order for a manuscript
made by the university library of Lund University dated 1966.

This is a collection of transcriptions (Greek) to John Chrysostom's Ad Stagirium

2024-11-29
Two manuscripts for Ad Stagirium book one have been set up, Vat1639 and LaSM.

The first page of each have been transcribed using OTE, the Online Transcription editor
at Birmingham https://itsee-wce.birmingham.ac.uk/ote/transcriptiontool

The work was exported and id's in the xml were adjusted so that the exported files
match the names of files in git. They can just be copied over the old file.
