Editing word order in the Standalone Collation Editor when using CollateX can be a bit tricky, but here are some steps to help you manage it:

1. **Load Your Collation**: Open the Standalone Collation Editor and load your collation data.

2. **Identify Word Order Variations**: Use the editor to identify where the word order variations occur. CollateX will mark these as deletions and insertions.

3. **Manual Adjustments**: You may need to manually adjust the collation to reflect the correct word order. This can involve moving tokens around within the editor to match the intended sequence.

4. **Use Custom Token Comparators**: If word order variations are common in your texts, consider defining custom token comparators in CollateX. This can help the tool better handle these variations during the collation process.

5. **Post-Processing**: After making adjustments in the editor, you can use post-processing scripts to refine the output. This can help ensure that the final collation accurately reflects the intended word order.
