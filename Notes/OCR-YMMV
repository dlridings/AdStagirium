Every time this work I am doing is explained for a language engineer, they seem to think that AI will be able to read the manuscripts for me. I always have to counter that that will not happen, not in my lifetime at least. For a presentation in October I am gathering some examples of why I feel so.

The main problem with approaching Greek MS with OCR is that the result has to be 100% correct. If it isn't, nothing has been achieved. If the result has to be corrected, one might as well start with a digital text and revise it according to the MS.

Bodl 170r3 (μόνον) can demonstrate why OCR is not ever going to work, and it is a neat and tidy manuscript. It looks like "ιον" is written above the line, making the reading μονιον. But the first character is an accent: μόν-ον Occurs again as the last word on the page.
