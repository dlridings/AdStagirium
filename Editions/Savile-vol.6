Savile's edition, online

There are a lot of errors in these responses, but some interesting information as well.


In Volume 6 of Sir Henry Savile’s edition of *John Chrysostom*, Savile provides variant readings drawn from a carefully curated set of Greek manuscripts. While the printed volume itself doesn’t always explicitly list every manuscript by shelfmark, Savile’s editorial method—especially in the *Ad Stagirium* treatises—relied on a core group of authoritative codices.

Based on scholarly reconstructions and Savile’s own notes, the manuscripts he most likely used for variant readings in Volume 6 include:

### 📜 Key Manuscripts Consulted by Savile
- **Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1431** – A 10th-century manuscript of Chrysostom’s homilies *** wrong ***
- **Codex Coislinianus 237 (Paris)** – A major witness to Chrysostom’s corpus
- **Codex Bodleianus (Oxford)** – Savile had access to several Greek manuscripts at Oxford, including those now catalogued in the Savile collection
- **Codex Regius (Paris, Gr. 679)** – Frequently cited in early patristic editions
- **Codices from Eton College and Merton College** – Where Savile had direct access during his editorial work

Savile often collated these manuscripts himself or through scribes, and he occasionally notes variant readings in the margins or footnotes of the printed text. However, unlike modern critical editions, he didn’t provide a full apparatus criticus or list of sigla.

If you're working with a specific passage—say, from *Ad Stagirium*—I can help identify which variants are noted and what manuscripts they may correspond to. Would you like to dive into a particular folio or line?

You're right to raise an eyebrow—**Codex Vaticanus gr. 1431** is *not* one of the famous biblical manuscripts like **Codex Vaticanus gr. 1209**, which contains much of the Greek Bible. Instead, **Vaticanus gr. 1431** is a lesser-known manuscript housed in the Vatican Library, and it’s not recent—it dates back to **late antiquity or the early Byzantine period**, though its exact dating varies by scholar.

What makes it interesting is that it contains **anti-Chalcedonian texts**, including letters and theological material from the time of Emperor Zeno (late 5th century). It was studied and published in part by **Eduard Schwartz** in 1927 under the title *Codex Vaticanus Gr. 1431: Eine antichalkedonische Sammlung aus der Zeit Kaiser Zenos*.

So while it’s not a biblical codex in the usual sense, it’s a **valuable patristic and historical source**, especially for those studying early Christological controversies and the reception of the Council of Chalcedon.

Would you like help finding a digital edition or summary of its contents?

Absolutely, Daniel! A digital edition of *Codex Vaticanus gr. 1431*—the anti-Chalcedonian Greek manuscript studied by Eduard Schwartz—is available thanks to the **Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana’s digitization efforts**.

After pointing the error in the above response I got:

Wonderful! Let’s map out the **actual manuscript sources** that Sir Henry Savile likely used—or had access to—when preparing **Volume 6** of his *Opera Omnia* of John Chrysostom (1610–1613). While Savile didn’t include a modern-style critical apparatus, scholars have reconstructed much of his editorial base.

### 📜 Manuscripts Savile Likely Used for Volume 6 (Can't really be trusted)

#### 🏛️ **Oxford & Eton Manuscripts**
Savile had privileged access to Greek manuscripts at:
- **Bodleian Library, Oxford** – including what are now catalogued as **MSS. Savile 1–52**
- **Eton College Library** – where he served as Provost

These included patristic texts, many of which were collated by Savile or his assistants. Some of these manuscripts are now part of the **Savile Collection** at the Bodleian.

#### 📚 **Parisian Codices (Coislin Collection)**
- Savile corresponded with scholars in **Paris** and likely used collations from the **Coislinian manuscripts**, such as:
  - **Coislin 237** – a key Chrysostom witness 
  - **Coislin 234** – containing homilies and ascetical works (actually, Basil, not Chrysostom)

These were among the most authoritative Greek witnesses in Western Europe at the time.

#### 🏛️ **Venetian & Florentine Manuscripts**
- Through scholarly networks, Savile may have received variant readings from:
  - **Marcianus Graecus** (Venice)
  - **Laurentianus** (Florence)

Though he likely didn’t travel to Italy himself, he had access to collations or copies.

### 🧠 Editorial Method
Savile’s edition:
- **Lacks sigla** (no manuscript symbols)
- Includes **marginal variant readings** and **textual notes**
- Often reflects a **preference for older, fuller readings**, even when unsupported by later consensus

He also worked without a Latin translation, which made his edition less accessible but more philologically pure.

Would you like help identifying which of these manuscripts contain *Ad Stagirium* specifically—or how they compare to later editions like Montfaucon or Migne? I can also help you trace how the text evolved across editions.

You really can't trust the answers. Ad Stagirum does not occur in Coislin 234

237
Coislin 237 – BnF, Greek 237
Unfortunately, a direct digital scan of Coislin 237 does not appear to be available online at this time.

It is, however, catalogued in the Pinakes database and was used by Montfaucon in his Bibliotheca Coisliniana.
